            <h1>About Solensia for Cats</h1>
            <img src="https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Calico-maine-coon-cat-walking-on-empty-large-wooden-deck.jpg">
            <p>Solensia is a brand name for frunevetmab, manufactured by Zoetis. Frunevetmab is a felinized immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody.</p>

            <p>An antibody is a protein created by the immune system to target a particular substance. Usually, we think about antibodies against something like a virus, which helps the body avoid or quickly eliminate a viral infection.</p>
                
            <p>A monoclonal antibody is a synthetic antibody that is designed to target only one specific substance. Felinized simply means that the monoclonal antibody is designed to work specifically in a cat’s body and cannot be used in other animal species.</p>
                
            <p>As a monoclonal antibody, Solensia’s target substance is something called nerve growth factor (NGF). In adult animals, NGF is elevated in response to injury, disease, and noxious stimuli and contributes to neurogenic inflammation and increased perception of pain.</p>
                
            <p>NGF has been found in both humans and other animal species to be involved with types of chronic pain, such as that caused by osteoarthritis (OA), where NGF has been found to be elevated in arthritic joints.</p>
                
            <p>Frunevetmab works by binding to NGF, thereby preventing NGF from binding to other receptors that are involved with furthering signals of pain and inflammation.</p>
                
            <p>Solensia is FDA-approved for use in cats specifically for the treatment of pain associated with feline osteoarthritis. It is available only as an injection that is given under the skin at a veterinary clinic once a month.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="effect">
            <h1>What Does Solensia Do for Cats?</h1>
            <img src="https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cat-itching.jpg">
            <p>In recent years, it has become more apparent through research studies that osteoarthritis (OA) is more common in cats than previously thought. Studies have shown that although cats may have x-ray evidence of arthritis, far fewer of those cats show obvious signs of pain and decreased mobility at home. This can make arthritis in cats difficult to appreciate at home, or diagnose during veterinary visits.</p>

            <p>But the treatment of arthritis is also challenging for cats and their caretakers. No non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication is approved for safe long-term use in cats, and the use of steroids has fallen out of favor given the association between long-term use and a higher risk of side effects.</p>

            <p>Pain medications, like gabapentin or buprenorphine, may often be considered. But while they can reduce pain and help with comfort, they do not target the underlying joint inflammation causing the pain.</p>

            <p>Orally medicating cats can also be challenging, so even in cases where a pain medication, such as gabapentin, can be used long-term to manage pain, the high affinity for many cats to sniff out medication hidden in food or treats as well as the difficulty of pilling/medicating directly by mouth can lead to major consistency problems with treatment at home.</p>

            <p>Solensia provides a potential solution to many of these concerns with a focused drug that appears to be very well tolerated for longer-term use, even in older cats, as well as eliminating the oral route entirely since the injection must be given at the vet’s office.</p>

            <p>According to early studies, a single Solensia injection provided significant pain relief as evidenced by increased activity for up to 6 weeks in cats with degenerative joint disease (DJD). Based on owner assessments alone, about ¾ of cats receiving 3 doses of Solensia were considered to be treatment successes.</p>

            <p>While still a newer product as of the time of this writing, Solensia appears to be the first drug of its kind that can be tolerated by cats for long-term use for joint pain and inflammation with the added bonus of eliminating the stress and compliance issues of medicating at home.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dosage">
            <h1>Solensia for Cats Dosage</h1>
            <img src="https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Cute-blue-eyed-cat-is-lying-on-the-table-while-veterinarians-are-doing-an-injection.jpg">
            <p>Solensia is FDA-approved for use in cats, but can only be administered legally by a veterinarian or a trained veterinary staff member under the supervision of a DVM.</p>

            <p>Dosing of Solensia is based on weight and is injected subcutaneously under the skin once a month. Each 1ml vial of Solensia contains 7 mg of frunevetmab. Cats weighing 5.5 to 15.4 lb (2.5-7 kg) receive one vial with cats exceeding 15.5 lb receiving two vials.</p>
                
            <p>Following an initial dose, Solensia is designed to be continued as a monthly injection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="conclude">
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <img src="https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Cat-close-up-basking-near-owner.jpg">
            <p>Solensia is an injectable medication approved for use in cats to treat osteoarthritis. It provides the only current longer-term treatment option for cats that can address both pain and components of inflammation arthritis causes.</p>

            <p>The long-acting injection also eliminates the need for oral dosing, which can be difficult for many kitties and their caretakers. Though it is still relatively new, early pilot field and safety studies suggest Solensia has a favorable safety profile.</p>
